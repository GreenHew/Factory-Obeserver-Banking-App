# JavaCoreTemplate
Includes:
* Program.java, with a main() that is ready to go.
* Libraries - sbccore, commons-lang3, junit
* Use println() instead of System.out.println().  Lots of other functions that make Java life much nicer:  readFile(), readFileAsLines(), writeFile(), readln().  See sbcccore for details.
